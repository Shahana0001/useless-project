### Project Description
[The Complementing Mirror Project is a simple mirror that gives random compliments when you look into it. It's meant to be fun, but doesn't really serve any practical¬†purpose.]

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
[Normal mirrors just reflect your face‚Ä¶ they never tell you how amazing you.]
]

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
[By giving the mirror a brain (sort of) and a voice, so it can spot you, pick a random compliment, and say it out loud ‚Äî turning your daily reflection into a mini confidence party.]
